Basic data processing for British Antarctic Survey archival tags.
Provides facilities for importing and plotting data recorded by the
BAS tags, and in particular detecting times of twilight from the
recorded light data.

## Installing

The package is easily installed from GitHub, using the devtools package. 

```R
devtools::install_github("SWotherspoon/BAStag")
```

If you don't have `devtools` installed already, install it first. 

```R
install.packages("devtools")
```

(BAStag otherwise does not need devtools for normal use.)
